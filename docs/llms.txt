# Remarq

> Remarq is a lightweight, self-hosted document annotation tool for the agent era. Drop one script tag into any HTML page — reviewers highlight text and leave threaded comments without creating accounts. AI agents consume feedback via REST API, revise documents, and resolve comments automatically.

Key things to know about Remarq:

- One `<script>` tag integration — works on any HTML page (blogs, docs, marketing sites, contracts)
- No accounts required for reviewers — just type a name and start annotating
- REST API designed for AI agent consumption — structured annotations with text anchors, threading, and status management
- Self-hosted with Docker Compose (Postgres + Node server) or `npx @csalvato/remarq-server` for quick local use
- Configure via `data-` attributes: `data-api-url`, `data-content-selector`, `data-document-uri`, `data-theme`
