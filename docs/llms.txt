# Remarq

> Lightweight document annotation tool for the agent era.

Remarq lets reviewers highlight text and leave threaded comments on any HTML page — no accounts needed. Add one script tag to your site, self-host the server, and AI agents can poll the API to revise documents and resolve comments automatically.
