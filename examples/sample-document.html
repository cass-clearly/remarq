  <h1>The Future of Collaborative Document Editing</h1>
  <p class="meta">Draft v0.1 — Open for review</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Collaborative document editing has evolved significantly over the past decade.
    From simple track changes in desktop word processors to real-time co-editing in
    cloud-based tools, the way teams create and refine documents continues to change.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, a gap remains between <em>collecting feedback</em> and <em>acting on it</em>.
    Reviewers leave comments, but authors must manually synthesize dozens of suggestions
    into a coherent revision. This process is time-consuming and error-prone.
  </p>

  <h2>The Annotation Layer</h2>
  <p>
    Web annotations, standardized by the W3C Web Annotation Data Model, provide a
    powerful mechanism for attaching feedback directly to specific passages of text.
    Unlike document comments that exist in a sidebar, annotations are anchored to
    the content they reference using text selectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remarq implements this as a lightweight annotation layer that can be embedded in
    any web page. Reviewers highlight text, leave comments, and these annotations
    are stored via a REST API.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "The web is a conversation. Annotations make that conversation visible."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>AI-Assisted Revision</h2>
  <p>
    Large language models can bridge the gap between feedback collection and revision.
    By formatting reviewer annotations as structured input to an LLM, we can generate
    a first-pass revision that addresses each piece of feedback. The author then reviews
    the AI's suggestions rather than starting from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach preserves human judgment at every step: reviewers provide the feedback,
    the AI proposes changes, and the author makes the final decision. The AI serves as
    a capable assistant that accelerates the revision cycle without replacing human
    creativity or editorial control.
  </p>

  <h2>Workflow</h2>
  <p>The proposed workflow has four steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Author publishes an HTML document with the Remarq script tag embedded</li>
    <li>Reviewers highlight text and leave comments</li>
    <li>An AI agent polls <code>GET /comments?status=open</code> to collect feedback</li>
    <li>The agent revises the document and resolves comments via the API</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    By combining open web annotation standards with modern AI, we can create a
    document revision workflow that is both more efficient and more inclusive. Every
    reviewer's voice is heard, and the revision process is transparent and traceable.
