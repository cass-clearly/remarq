# Commercial License

Remarq is available under a dual license:

- **Open Source** — [GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)](./LICENSE)
- **Commercial / Enterprise** — Separate commercial license without AGPL obligations

## When You Need a Commercial License

If your use case requires you to keep your source code proprietary — for example, offering Remarq as part of a hosted/managed service or embedding it in a closed-source product — you need a commercial license.
